# CMP MVC Framework

## Description
This project is a custom-built framework following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It's designed to provide a deeper understanding of popular frameworks like Laravel. The development process will unfold step by step in a dedicated branch (`develop`) and will be made available on GitHub at [https://github.com/jpcodeplus/mvc](https://github.com/jpcodeplus/mvc).

Each step of the project will be committed with a `feat:name` tag to clearly separate and identify the features being developed.
